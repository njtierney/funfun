# Audience

1.  Someone who has never written a function
2.  Someone who has written a couple of functions
3.  The sceptic function user
4.  The regular function user
5.  Various members of the R Core Team
    1.  Thomas Lumley
    2.  Simon Urbanek
    3.  Paul Murrell

I want to start by saying that I want to cover a range of different audiences in this talk. I want this talk to be helpful for someone who has never written a function, through to someone who has written a couple of functions - the person who is suspicious of functions and doesn't really get the point - the regular function user, and also, I hope I can convey something useful to the various members of the R Core team and R developers. note: Make this a line graph or something?

::: notes
The thing that I want to communicate here is "I've learnt a lot from others - and in some ways this talk is just me remixing the important messages that others have already spent a good deal more time doing". So I want to start by firstly acknowledging five people whose talks and work have helped me understand functions in a deeper way to become a better programmer, and I want to note a key thing that they helped me understand.

## Key points

::: notes
I wanted to be able to understand and communicate what I was doing

I was Frustrated by not being able express those ideas

Functions were the form of expression that I wanted

Why didn't I see that earlier? It's because functions weren't explained to me in terms of chunking/decluttering/breaking down complexity.

They were introduced as "celcius to farenheit", or "mean center a value" or "find odd numbers".

It's not that those things weren't useful

## The impact of missingness?

```{r}
#| echo: false
airquality %>% 
  select(Temp,
         Solar.R) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  tt() %>% 
  style_tt(
    i = 1:4,
    j = 1:2,
    background = "teal",
    color = "white",
    bold = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  style_tt(
    i = 5:6,
    j = 1:2,
    background = "coral",
    color = "white",
    bold = TRUE
  )
```

## The impact of missingness?

```{r}
#| echo: false
var_missing <- airquality$Solar.R
var_interest <- airquality$Temp
which_missing <- which(is.na(var_missing))
which_complete <- which(!is.na(var_missing))

var_interest_miss <- var_interest[which_missing]
var_interest_complete <- var_interest[which_complete]

na_aq <- nabular(airquality) 
ggplot(na_aq,
       aes(x = Solar.R_NA,
           y = Temp,
           fill = Solar.R_NA,
           colour = Solar.R_NA)) +

## A script:

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- na.omit(airquality$Temp[which(is.na(airquality$Solar.R))])
y <- na.omit(airquality$Temp[which(!is.na(airquality$Solar.R))])

x_mean_diff <- (x - (sum(x) / length(x)))^2
sum_x_mean_diff <- sum(x_mean_diff)
s_x <- sqrt((1 / length(x)) * sum_x_mean_diff)
se_x <- s_x / sqrt(length(x))

y_mean_diff <- (y - (sum(y) / length(y)))^2
sum_y_mean_diff <- sum(y_mean_diff)
s_x <- sqrt((1 / length(y)) * sum_y_mean_diff)
se_y <- s_x / sqrt(length(y))

numerator <- mean(x) - mean(y)
denominator <- sqrt(se_x + se_y)

result <- numerator / denominator

```

## A(n) improved script:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2"
var_missing <- airquality$Solar.R
var_interest <- airquality$Temp
which_missing <- which(is.na(var_missing))
which_complete <- which(!is.na(var_missing))

var_interest_miss <- var_interest[which_missing]
var_interest_complete <- var_interest[which_complete]

result <- t.test(var_interest_miss, y = var_interest_complete)

result
```

## Can I use other variables?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2"
var_missing <- airquality$Ozone
var_interest <- airquality$Wind
which_missing <- which(is.na(var_missing))
which_complete <- which(!is.na(var_missing))

var_interest_miss <- var_interest[which_missing]
var_interest_complete <- var_interest[which_complete]

result <- t.test(var_interest_miss, y = var_interest_complete)

result
```

## ...eventually...a function!

```{r}
#| echo: true
missingness_impact <- function(when_missing, is_different){
  when_missing_index <- which(is.na(when_missing))
  when_complete_index <- which(!is.na(when_missing))
  
  is_different_miss <- is_different[when_missing_index]
  is_different_complete <- is_different[when_complete_index]
  
  result <- t.test(is_different_miss, y = is_different_complete)
  
  result
  
}
```

## Functions = expression

```{r}
#| echo: true
missingness_impact(
  when_missing = airquality$Solar.R,
  is_different = airquality$Temp
)
```

## Functions = expression

```{r}
#| echo: true
missingness_impact(
  when_missing = airquality$Ozone,
  is_different = airquality$Temp
)
```

## Teaching functions?

```{r}
celcius_to_farenheit <- function(x){
  (x * 9/5) + 32
}

celcius_to_farenheit(0)
celcius_to_farenheit(25)
```

. . .

```{r}
odd_number <- function(x){
  (x %% 2) == 0
}
odd_number(2)
odd_number(7)
```

::: notes
It doesn't showcase the power It makes it seem trivial
:::

## DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

> If you copy and paste the same code 3 times, write a function

. . .

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1:2|6|8:9|13"

is_different <- airquality$Temp
when_missing_index <- which(is.na(airquality$Ozone))
when_complete_index <- which(!is.na(airquality$Ozone))
is_different_miss <- is_different[when_missing_index]
is_different_complete <- is_different[when_complete_index]
result_ozone_temp <- t.test(is_different_miss, y = is_different_complete)

is_different <- airquality$Wind
when_missing_index <- which(is.na(airquality$Solar.R))
when_complete_index <- which(!is.na(airquality$Solar.R))
is_different_miss <- is_different[when_missing_index]
is_different_complete <- is_different[when_complete_index]
result_solar_wind <- t.test(is_different_miss, y = is_different_complete)
  
```

::: notes
You've only written this out twice But you'll revisit it more than once You've got to manually parse what is different The structure is the same It's like a game of spot the difference idea: show images where two Where is the difference? - THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE - YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR TIME

## DRY: Don't ~~Repeat~~ re-read Yourself

# Function Fundamentals

The basics of what a function is, and the typical motivations for using them DRY, etc

Moving on to the motivations for what functions do well - emphasise actions (prior art hadley) - and how you can write bad functions that don't emphasise or name the actions

1.  The basics of what a function is, and the typical motivations for using them - DRY etc.
    1.  But the point here isn't so much about avoiding repitition, it's about expression
    2.  That's what I was chasing earlier - it wasn't about avoiding repetition, it was about my expression being cut off (maybe quote Jacob Collier?)
    3.  conclusion: Functions are about managing complexity

# Is it hard to write a function?

celcius to farenheit: boom. done.

The idea of inputs and outputs isn't hard.

What's hard it taking a data analysis and finding the parts that need to change

> There's a level of "I got it to work" And "It works, and I can reason about it"

To motivate the process of re-reading your work

Chunking and moving from numbers

Miles' SSA talk: Let's borrow some key ideas from how we structure books: table of contents as a key to help.

# Functions in Practice

1.  Moving on to the motivations for what functions do well - emphasise actions (prior art hadley) - and how you can write bad functions that don't emphasise or name the actions
    1.  This section is about managing complexity, and scaling that appropriately
    2.  compile_report() vs six steps that go into that.
    3.  Conclusion: The idea of chunking up code to break down complexity. communicate the idea that this is an iterative process - as Hadley said in his "design of everyday functions" talk, you need to write, then rewrite, then re-re-re-re-write functions, in the same way that it takes time to write text to communicate to others. (might be a good time to
2.  Model how you do this part of your work. How do you move from writing code to writing functions. Writing functions doesn't have to be this "sometimes" activity - it should be part of a healthy data analysis. I will go through some common parts of a data analysis, and demonstrate a process for writing out steps as functions, and also special tools for creating, and understanding functions (fnmate, browser (also debugonce and recover). I want to cover this idea that you can use functions to manage your own complexity.
    1.  If you are doing a data analysis - moving from multiple scripts
3.  Model how you do this part of your work. How do you move from writing code to writing functions. Writing functions doesn't have to be this "sometimes" activity - it should be part of a healthy data analysis. To do this I want to model this behaviour by walking through a data analysis, and demonstrating writing functions, and also special tools for creating, and understanding functions (fnmate, browser (also debugonce and recover))
    -   Other ideas to demonstrate in this demo

        -   Maybe I want to simulate restarting R and coming back to it

            -   Ah man, I don't want to re-run this data analysis now.

# Let's use this overview of functions to do the thing

-   introduce Debugging: the tools of the trade
-   story of learning debugging
-   Do we jump back
-   The poor mans (other version?) debugger
-   introduce browser

# Good and Bad Functions (maybe ditch this)

1.  Moving on to code smells and other practices you can use in your coding (prior art Jenny)

    1.  conclusion: here are some general tips on writing good functions
    2.  game: good function / bad function?

important ideas: - bad names vs good names - bad arguments vs good arguments - body code that's too terse - If it fails it does it loudly vs quietly

Creative process - taste exceeds ability - creating things for you vs creating things for others

moving on to code smells and other practices you can use in your coding (prior art Jenny)

-   Can you guess what the function does by its name and inputs?

# Developing Your Craft

1.  Finally points for growth - how do you get better at writing functions in your own life? some ideas: read other people's code! use things like targets! peer review your code with colleagues. Tell a story about how I was taught debugging when I first started programming and I just did not understand the reason why I would care. The reason it turns out - is that I didn't yet know about the idea of interactive vs non-interactive, or rather - the practitioner-programmer spectrum. And I guess that this is summarised by a nice slide from Hadley (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qne86lxjgtg>) - "you hear your code scream" vs "things break and people scream at you".

Hadley talks about this idea of "code is a conversation" - when things break, or don't work, if you're working in this script-land, then you know when this breaks, and you might be able to jump back into things.

But if you're in programmer land, there's a wall between you and your code...sometimes.

Summarise by talking about how we slide from the user \<--\> developer seamlessly. This is actually what R is designed to do!:

If you can take away one thing from this talk, practice Joe Cheng's point:

> break up inherently complicated things that we are trying to do into small pieces that are individually easy to reason about

# Some thoughts

There are three things that I want to communicate in this talk:

1.  Good functions are tools to manage complexity

2.  Good functions are tools to explain and express ideas

3.  Good functions can be individually reasoned with

There are ~~three~~ 3 things ~~that~~ I want to communicate ~~in this talk~~:

Good functions:

1.  ~~Good functions~~ ~~a~~Are tools to manage complexity

2.  ~~Good functions~~ ~~a~~Are tools to explain and express ideas

3.  ~~Good functions~~ ~~a~~Can be individually reasoned with

**Good** functions:

1.  Manage **complexity**

2.  Explain and express **ideas**

3.  Can be **individually reasoned** with
