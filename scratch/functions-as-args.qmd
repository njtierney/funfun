# things you might not know you can do with functions

The idea of a functional: you can pass a function as an argument to a
function.

You might see this if you are taking column wise means, perhaps doing
something like:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
apply(mtcars, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)
```

(Note that `colMeans` is a thing:)

```{r}
colMeans(mtcars)
```

OK, so maybe you knew that, but think of how you might be able to apply
this

(also come up with a more useful example of why you'd want to take the
column mean of some data?)

```{r}
new_fun <- function(func) func(runif(1e3))
new_fun(median)
```
