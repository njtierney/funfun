Against defaults

-   I don't want to give them defaults that might mean they make a bad
    decision

    -   e.g., make users specify bindwidth on a histogram

-   But then why are you giving them tools that they can't discern the
    validity of?

-   So could you invest in some diagnostics or things so that the users
    can determine if it is valid?

    -   You save pain on the sad path: no default

    -   save pain on happy path: because there is a default

Giving them less

-   an argument for removing arguments/decision paralysis
