# good process

Discuss a process for writing and using functions

-   Each function goes into an R/ folder
-   Write a script that sources the R/ folder
-   The script then does all these steps
-   Use keyboard shortcuts like fnmate
-   if your work takes a long time to run...consider tools like
    `targets`
    -   you've already done the work of writing functions - targets
        likes that
