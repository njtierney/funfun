# functional style

From Hadley:

> Itâ€™s hard to describe exactly what a functional *style* is, but
  generally I think it means decomposing a **big problem into smaller pieces**,
  then solving **each** piece with a function or combination of
  functions. When using a functional style, you strive to decompose
  components of the problem into isolated functions that operate
  independently. Each function taken by itself is simple and
  straightforward to understand; complexity is handled by composing
  functions in various ways.
