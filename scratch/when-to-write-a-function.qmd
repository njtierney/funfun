# When to write a function

## The goals of functions

I think functions at their best do three things:

1. They manage complexity
2. They can be individually reasoned with
3. They express their intent

Functions are tools to help manage complexity. If you don't experience complexity, a function might not be needed.

## When to write a function

If you're not sure if you should write a function, try asking two
questions:

1.  "Is there complexity I don't need to remember every time?"
2.  "Is there an idea that I want to express or evoke?"

If the answer is yes to either of these, then you should write a
function.

    complexity of the analysis
